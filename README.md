# University group project
# Peat monitoring device
### This is the repository for used for storage of all relevant resources used for the university group project.<br>
### The project involved development of a device that would be placed in a peat and provides measuremetns about the peat state.</br>
### Measurements include:
* Surface elevation - shows how much peat surface changed water in it.</br>
* Water pressure - shows the pressure created by the peat water table.</br>
* Temperature - shows temperature of surroundings around the device.</br>
* Operate for at least 6 months unsupervised and store all data.</br>
### A poster was created for the device:</br>

The respository was created and managed by Danielius Zurlys. Project work done by Danielius Zurlys:<br>
* All embedded software<br>
* Hardware and mechanical designs for pressure sensor<br>
* Hardware and mechanical designs for temperature sensor<br>
### Work done by other group members:<br>
* Oliver Davies - Developed PCB for STM32<br>
* Chuan Loo - Developed PCB for battery control<br>
* Sever Dragomir - Design for main case and elevantion sensor.<br>
* James Bodenham - RF communication hardware choice and logic<br>
