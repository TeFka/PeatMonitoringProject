# Pressure sensor mechanical designs
### Designs include:<br>
1. Direct case - a case that would allow the pressure sensor to sense the underground water pressure directly.<br>
2. Tube case - a case that would allow the pressure sensor to sense the water pressure using compressed air in a tube. The water would rise up the tube and compress the air in the tube, which would then be measured by the pressure sensor. The pressre of compressed air is equal to the water pressure applied at the end of the tube, therefore the approach can provide good results.<br>
<br>
The tube design has potential to increase logevity of the pressure sensor by avoiding the direct contact with acidic and hazardous peat environment, while direct design is simpler and more reliable.<br>
